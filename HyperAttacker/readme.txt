# Hyperbolic Graph Attack Simulation

This folder provides an implementation for simulating hyperbolic attack. The attack process involves estimating Poincar√© embeddings and using them as inputs to `HyperAttacker`.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nikimal99/HyperAttacker-vs-HyperDefender/
cd hyperbolic-attack
